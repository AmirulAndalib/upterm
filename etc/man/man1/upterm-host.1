.SH NAME
.PP
upterm\-host \- Host a terminal session


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBupterm host [flags]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Host a terminal session via a reverse SSH tunnel to the upterm server. By default, the command authenticates against the upterm server using the private keys located at \fB\fC\~/.ssh/id\_dsa\fR, \fB\fC\~/.ssh/id\_ecdsa\fR, \fB\fC\~/.ssh/id\_ed25519\fR, and \fB\fC\~/.ssh/id\_rsa\fR\&. The host can permit a list of client public keys by specifying an authorized\_keys file. By default, the input/output of the host attaches to the input/output of the client's. The host can force the execution of a command after the client joins, and attach the input/output of this command to the client's.
